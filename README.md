This is a lightweight demonstration of my final year project which uses a combination of computer vision and deep learning to identify mistakes in the forehand throw commonly used in ultimate frisbee.

Due to size and privacy limitations, the original videos and json files containing the keypoints cannot be included, only the pre-processed keypoints are included in the form of the train and test sets.

The models should still be able to be trained from there and if training fails or you do not want to go through the training step, you can use the pre-trained models in the models folder.

The main code is written in the Jupyter notebook environment using Python and is ideally opened in Google Colab but contains comments that should be helpful regardless of the IDE used.
