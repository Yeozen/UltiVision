Due to size limitations, the original videos and json files containing the keypoints cannot be included, only the pre-processed keypoints are included in the form of the train and test sets.

The models should still be able to be trained from there and if training fails or you do not want to go through the training step, you can use the pre-trained models in the models folder.

The main code is in the form of jupyter notebooks and is ideally opened in google colab but contains comments that should be helpful regardless of the IDE used.
